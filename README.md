# spTotal
Suite of molecular and computational workflows for Spatial Total RNA-Sequencing (STRS)

#### See our preprint [here]()!

This repository has all the protocols and scripts you will need to run STRS on any sample!

### Sub-directory descriptions:
- `manuscripts`: .pdf files of the preprint and subsequent manuscript (hopefully!)
- `protocols`: Microsoft word and .pdf documents of the protocols used here
- `pipelines`: Snakemake workflows used in our study. These include alignment pipelines for STRS data (kallisto & STARsolo) & small RNAseq data (STAR & miRge3.0)
- `scripts`: All the other code we used! Mostly contains R scripts and utility functions used in our spatial analyses.
