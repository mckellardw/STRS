# 10x Total - protocols

This  directory contains protocols for the preparation and processing of samples for single-cell, single-nucleus, and spatial total RNA-sequencing. We built these workflows using a few existing protocols, listed below:

- 10x Genomics [methanol fixation](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-methanol-fixation-of-cells-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing)
- 10x Genomics [nuclei preparation](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-isolation-of-nuclei-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing)
- Skeletal muscle nuclei preparation [(Petrany et al, *Nat Comm*, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20063-w)
- [sci-RNA-seq3](https://www.protocols.io/view/sci-rna-seq3-9yih7ue)
